# Task list

Github issues is too much overhead and clicking on the UI things. Therefore, the task list/tree is stored directly in the repository, as a Markdown file.

* [x] Add a way to see all the changes on the project
* [x] Implement support for task lists in the app itself; maybe in the simplest way via associating a file with a project
  * [x] Add a button to open "Open File" dialog
  * [x] Save the associated file into the model
  * [x] When there is file associated with a project, the name should be displayed as a hyperlink
  * [x] Clicking the hyperlink should actually open a file
